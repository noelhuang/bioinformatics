Python 3 script to find shortest path from a point to another in a simple directed graph.

Usage: CMD line: py BIF005.py <edge list format file> <number of starting vertex>
Args:
    <edge list format file>: Edge list format in txt format.
    <number of starting vertex>: Integer, which is the number of the starting vertex. Usually this is 1.
